## Outlook: What's next?

-   Getting started with Monte Carlo Simulation

-   Now you want to use Monte Carlo Simulation ...

    -   ... for (self-) teaching

    -   ... for *a priori* power calculation

    -   ... for your next methods study

## Resources: For simulating data

-   [{simstudy}](https://kgoldfeld.github.io/simstudy/): Very flexible package for simulating data sets.

## Resources: Simulation for *a priori* power calculation

-   [DeclareDesign](https://declaredesign.org/r/declaredesign/): "is a system for describing research designs in code and simulating them in order to understand their properties" --- not ony power simulation, but also diagnosis of bias.
